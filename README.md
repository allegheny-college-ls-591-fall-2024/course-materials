## Description

This 2-credit course is designed to refresh topics foundational
to Computational Expression (CMPSC 100) and to reinforce
beneficial practices related to computer use for majors and
non-majors. Topics include computer skills, tech literacy, pattern
identification, and algebra-based logic for computational problems.
Hands-on learning activities will contribute to team-building and
practice widely-applicable strategies for reasoning. Students will
receive individualized support, maximizing opportunities for success
in computer and information science and related fields. 

## Learning Outcomes

- navigate computer with graphical and text-based tools
- identify hierarchical structure within computational problems
- describe processes/strategies for computational problem solving
- describe/ USE fundamental computational operators
- implement algebra-based logic/strategies/skills in computational problems
