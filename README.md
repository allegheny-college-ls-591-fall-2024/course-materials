## Description

This 2-credit course is designed to refresh topics foundational
to Computational Expression (CMPSC 100) and to reinforce
beneficial practices related to computer use for majors and
non-majors. Topics include computer skills, tech literacy, pattern
identification, and algebra-based logic for computational problems.
Hands-on learning activities will contribute to team-building and
practice widely-applicable strategies for reasoning. Students will
receive individualized support, maximizing opportunities for success
in computer and information science and related fields. 

## Learning Outcomes

1. navigate computer with graphical and text-based tools
2. identify hierarchical/sequential structure within computational problems
3. describe processes/strategies for computational problem solving
4. describe and use fundamental computational operators
5. implement algebra-based logic/strategies/skills in computational problems

## Topics

- file hierarchy and navigation, terminal usage, typing (LO 1)
- making explicit the steps needed for accomplishing task (LO 2, LO 3)
- Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, estimation / back-of-the-envelope calculations (LO 4, LO 5)
- Establish good practices
  - search for and use resources
  - when and how to ask question
  - how to take notes
  - how to pattern match

will automatically result in a failing grade.

Add/drop deadline September 9 at 12 pm


### Seeking Assistance

### Effective Collaboration

Computer science is an inherently collaborative discipline. People must work
together to produce large, complex, and ultimately useful software systems.
Because of this, the Department of Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College
encourages students to engage in collaboration. However, in the context of
individual coursework, through which each student must demonstrate their own
knowledge, there are certain forms of collaboration that are and are not
acceptable. Follow the instructions given on activities and assignments regarding
collaboration.

### Honor Code

Allegheny College has a student-run Honor Code designed to promote individual
responsibility and integrity in academic affairs. Each student pledges the following:
“I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor
Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.”
Suspected Honor Code violations will be discussed with those involved and reported. Please see
https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/academic-honor-program/ for more details.

### Educational Accommodations

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are
encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at
(814) 332-2898.  Student Accessibility and Support Services is located in Pelletier
Library.  Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are
implemented in a timely fashion. Please see
