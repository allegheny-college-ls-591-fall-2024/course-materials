# Estimating the Unknowable - Pencils

## The Problem

How many pencils are on Allegheny College's campus?

In groups of 3-4, come up with three different ways to calculate the number of pencils on Campus.

## Learning Outcomes

Completing this activity will help you:

1. Hone ability to understand scope, determine what is in scope and out of scope
2. Create structure within a larger problem
3. Contrast more and less elegant structural solutions
4. Practice mathematical operations

## TODO

- Discuss in your group strategies to solve the problem.
- Diagram three strategies of your choice on whiteboards.
- Run the calculation for each strategy.
- Determine as a group which strategy is best
- Determine as a group your definition of `best` and why.
- Discuss as a group whether your solution would generalize to finding the number of pencils in any situation.
- What are the limitations or strengths of your strategy?

## Deliverables

- Three strategy diagrams on whiteboards
- Answers to the questions/requests above submitted into a [google form](https://forms.gle/PjbcRTPfuyBCmT8q8).
