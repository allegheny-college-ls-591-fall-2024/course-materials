# Wrap-up

Today you practiced problem solving strategies and mathematical operations on paper,
but these strategies and tools will be essential to coding itself, as well as
solving problems that arise due to unavoidable mistakes that occur during the coding process.

To solidify your understanding, watch this 12-minute
[video segment](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/106-7jqreOpa_cDKEp-1g5BMoANwMnRBejTjEIE6qxOM/preview?rm=minimal&slide=2)
on computational thinking
(also linked as homework in the [Course Schedule](/Schedule.md)). For next class, be prepared to
relate to one concept discussed in the video to an activity you completed today, and
to explain why they are related.
