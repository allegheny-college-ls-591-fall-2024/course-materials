# Local Development

Local development is computer-programming where the code you write lives on your computer's hard drive. 

In Computer Science 100, we started out doing all of our work in the web browser. While this is a great way to get started coding fast, local development is an important part of computer programming. It allows you to work on multiple files at once, to collaborate with other coders, and to work without an internet connection. It also allows you to version your code in Git so you can go back to different versions of what you've done and reference archived code.
