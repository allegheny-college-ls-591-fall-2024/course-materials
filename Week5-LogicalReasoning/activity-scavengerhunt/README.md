# Scavanger Hunt

Hide your group's Mario toy somewhere on campus. 

Keeping in mind what you learned in the PB&J activity, work with your group to create instructions for the other group to find the hidden toy. 

The instructions must be precise, but also shouldn't give away the answer too easily! (Think of an escape room). 

Return to the classrom with your instructions by 3:45 pm. 

Keep relatively close on Campus, so that the other group can find your Mario before class is over.
