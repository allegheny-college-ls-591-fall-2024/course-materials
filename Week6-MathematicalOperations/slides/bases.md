## Decimal

Decimal is our normal number/counting system in base 10 with digits 0-9. Places for the digits in
decimal are multiples of 10.

- 1000 place | 100 place | 10 place | 1 place

In decimal, the number 1101 indicates:

- 1 * 1000
- 1 * 100
- 0 * 10
- 1 * 1
- add everything together!

## Binary

Computers use binary representations of numbers and really, all symbols!

- `0` and `1` are the only binary digits

Places for the digits in binary are multiples of 2

- 8 place | 4 place | 2 place | 1 place

In binary, the number 1101 indicates:

- 1 * 8
- 1 * 4
- 0 * 2
- 1 * 1
- add everything together!

## Base 3

Places for the digits in base 3 are multiples of 3

- 27 place | 9 place | 3 place | 1 place

In base 3, the number 1101 indicates:

- 1 * 27
- 1 * 9
- 0 * 3
- 1 * 1
- add everything together!

## Hex

Hexadecimal is commonly used to represent digital information.

- digits are 0-9, A, B, C, D, E, F

## Questions

- what is the largest digit in binary (base 2)?
- what is the largest digit in decimal (base 10)?
- what is the largest digit in base 3?
- what base number is Hex?

## Warning

The number basis or base (like base 2, base 3) is NOT the same as "log base 2"...
