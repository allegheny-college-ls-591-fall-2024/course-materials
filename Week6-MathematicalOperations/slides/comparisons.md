# Comparisons

---

## Definition

Special symbols can be used to make comparisons between values on the left-hand side and right-hand side.

- `==` compares values, looking for equality
- `>` compares values, looking for the left-hand side to be larger
- `<` compares values, looking for the right-hand side to be larger
- `>=` compares values, looking for the left-hand side to be larger OR equal to the right-hand side
- `<=` compares values, looking for the right-hand side to be larger OR equal to the left-hand side
- `!=` compares values, looking for inequality

## True and False

If a comparison works out favorably, then we can say it is True! If a comparison does not work out, then was can say it is False.
  
## Examples

- `1 == 1` is True
- `20 == 10` is False
- `'Emily' == 'Graber'` is False
- `'Emily' != 'Graber'` is True
- `20 >= 10 + 10` is True
