## Factorials

- `5!` is 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1
- `6!` is 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1
- etc

## Logarithms

Opposite of powers.

- `2<sup>3</sup>` is 8
- `log<sub>2</sub>(8)` is 3

In the example above the base is 2.

Personally, I like to think about logarithms as the number of times the base can be divided out of the number until 1 is reached.

1. 8 divided by 2 is 4
2. 4 divided by 2 is 2
3. 2 divided by 2 is 1

It took 3 divisions by 2 to get down to 1.

- `log<sub>10</sub>(10000)`
  
1. 10000 divided by 10 is 1000
2. 1000 divided by 10 is 100
3. 100 dividied by 10 is 10
4. 10 divided by 10 is 1

It took 4 divisions by 2 to get down to 1.
