# Operators and Variables

---

Operators can be used on the right hand side of any variable assignment!
  
## Examples

- `a = 10 + 2` # the value of 23 is assigned to the variable a
- `b = 20 / 5` # the value of 4 is assigned to the variable b
- `c = 5 % 2` # the value of 1 is assigned to the variable c
- `full_name = 'Emily' + ' ' + 'Graber'` # the value of 'Emily Graber' is assigned to the variable full_name
