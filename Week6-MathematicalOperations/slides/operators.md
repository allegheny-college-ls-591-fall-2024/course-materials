# Operators

---

## Definition

- Operators are symbols that usually represent arithmetic
- The order of operations applies in python!
- PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
- Personally, I use parentheses to disambiguate mathematical expressions
  
## Symbols

- `+` plus
- `-` minus
- `*` multiply
- `/` divide
- `%` modulus
- `**` power

## Examples

- `2 + 5 * 5` is 5 times 5, then plus 2
- `5 % 2` is the remainder of 5 divided by 2
- `5 ** 2` is 5 raised to the power 2, or 5 times 5

## Extended Example

Python is very flexible and can _sometimes_ apply math-like operators to values that are NOT numbers!

- `'Emily' + ' ' + 'Graber'`

## Failing Example

This example does not work.

- `'Emily' / 'Graber'`
